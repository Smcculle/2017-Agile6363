Key points from the 21 research papers read in Agile Software Engineering

# Investigating the Skill Gap - Alex Radermacher 2014

### Summary
This paper interviewed hiring personnel to discover major shortcomings in new hires that recently graduated.  Students were found to be deficient in many key areas like project experience, communication, and using software tools.  Most issues were not discovered in the interview process.  Even those with experience in tool use, testing, and configuration management systems had often used only the most basic functionality, and struggled in a production environment.  

type:   **case study to verify literature review**
- 3 research questions
- 20 managers/hiring personnel in US, 3 from Europe
- soft skills, engineering practices, CS concepts, software tools

### Conclusion
The most commonly reported knowledge deficiencies that educators should address involve providing some type of real-world project experience, ensuring that students are exposed to the tools most commonly used in the software industry, making sure that students have effective problem solving skills and that students can effectively communicate their solutions to others, and that students have experience with writing unit tests for their code.

# Why Software Engineering Programs Should Teach Agile Software Development Orit Hazzan 2007
### Summary
Studying intro of Agile concepts into academia.  No major problems and positive reactions. Broad range of students enjoy agile, a prerequisite for industry adoption in their opinion.  

# Strengths  
- Short and concise.
- Issues range from technical and social to cognitive issues.
- Emphasis on need for teamwork and communication in software engineering curriculum.  

# Weaknesses
- Would have a stronger message with more detailed reasons.
- Does not discuss alternatives to Agile or barriers to introducing Agile to current programs.
- Some of the reasons were rather weak and unsupported, such as Agile supporting ethics development.  They should stick to  factual reasons backed up with citations from prior research and less opinions.   

type:   **theory proposal**
- 10 points with (somewhat) supported arguments

### Conclusion
Paper presents the author's perspective and offers no real value toward **how** it might be accomplished.

# Scaling Agile Methodologies Harprit Grewal 2007

type:   **case study**
- medium to large scale project, 2.5 years
- lessons learned
- TDD, pair programming, scrum

### Summary
XP and Scrum scaled well to 40+ size teams.  Scrum becomes scrum of scrums with team leads having scrum meeting.  Customer perceives high quality system, dev motivation high, rewarding, challenging.  

### Conclusion
Large scale Agile can be effective, but difficult.  Some changes are required.

# An Empirical Study of Internal Documentation Christoph Johann Stettina 2011

type:   **empirical study**
- investigate role of documentation in agile
- 79 professionals, 8 teams, 13 countries
- over half find documentation important, but too little exists in their project
- Face-to-face communication is not always most efficient?
- **transfer of development knowledge** becomes more important as time goes on

### Summary
Examination into documentation use for Agile teams.  This paper only covered Scrum, and found that face communication was valued much greater than documentation.  Issues discussed included situations such as distributed/global development, time zone differences, and other issues that prevent teams from having face to face communication.  The teams were asked about how their work is documented and the opinion of amount and importance of internal documentation.  

### Strengths  
- In depth analysis of Scrum documentation practices on these teams
- Results from 13 different countries instead of one or two helps differentiate between cultural trends and those resulting from Agile.  
- Encouraged truthful response and made available more details from the data source, such as variance, to offset the small sample size with transparency.  

### Weaknesses
- Focuses on only a subset of Agile (scrum).  Is this applicable to other Agile methodologies?  
- Low sample size.
- The contribution of this paper is a little unclear -- a survey paper, but the conclusions drawn are very generalized and not necessarily specific to Scrum or even Agile but software development as a whole in some cases. 

### Conclusion
Documentation is important and there is not enough.

# A Literature Review of Agile Practices Magnus Sletholt 2011

type:   **literature review**
- how well do scientific software dev processes match agile dev methods?
- effects of agile in such process?
- examine scientific projects explicitly and implicitly using agile
- Scrum and XP are considered
- **transfer of development knowledge** becomes more important as time goes on

### Summary
Examination into documentation use for Agile teams.  This paper only covered Scrum, and found that face communication was valued much greater than documentation.  Issues discussed included situations such as distributed/global development, time zone differences, and other issues that prevent teams from having face to face communication.  The teams were asked about how their work is documented and the opinion of amount and importance of internal documentation.  

### Strengths  
- In depth analysis of Scrum documentation practices on these teams
- Results from 13 different countries instead of one or two helps differentiate between cultural trends and those resulting from Agile.  
- Encouraged truthful response and made available more details from the data source, such as variance, to offset the small sample size with transparency.  

### Weaknesses
- Focuses on only a subset of Agile (scrum).  Is this applicable to other Agile methodologies?  
- Low sample size.
- The contribution of this paper is a little unclear -- a survey paper, but the conclusions drawn are very generalized and not necessarily specific to Scrum or even Agile but software development as a whole in some cases. 

### Conclusion
Documentation is important and there is not enough.

# Modeling User Story Completion Dan Houston 2013

type:   **case study**
- understand the sources of variation in the deliveries and best steps to improve delivery quality.

### Summary
The authors describe an industrial case study focusing on simulating the Agile process through software process simulation (SPS), which has been widely used since 1980s to understand software development dynamics.  Focus was placed on producing useful knowledge for the project rather than general knowledge about Agile development; however, the results were still applicable to the general case.  The team’s development process was modeled over a 2-month period.  Major sources of uncertainty were found when dealing with a single time-consuming task and quality escapes.  Four major changes were recommended to improve the process.  


### Strengths  
- Focuses on an actual project and the interactions between customer/client, with a focus on improving quality and not on studying the process.  This results in a more realistic scenario instead of a theoretical one.  
Very detailed model
- Sensitivity analysis for highly variable factors 
- Study required 200 hours which resulted in sufficient data and time to analyze factors. 
- Good review of literature for similar SPS 

### Weaknesses

- Since it was focused on an actual project, the recommendations and findings are specific to this team and its needs.  They can still be generalized, but mostly if other agile teams have similar problems. 
- Important roles such as project manager were left out of the model
- It would be nice to see the results of their recommendations on the team’s productivity. It says these recommendations are not surprising and it helped the team focus its process improvement efforts, but that is very vague.  They list some improvements the team enacted but there is no quantitative or qualitative information about how these improvements benefited them.   Are these recommendations useful? By what measure? 


### Conclusion
Major source of uncertainy:  
- other tasks that consume large amounts of developer effort 
- quality escapes

# Empirical Insights into the Perceived Benefits Christoph Schmidt 2014

type:   **case study**
- how developers perceive impact of pair programming, test automation
- delivered feature scope, various teamwork aspects  
- 174 developers, 74 etams, 15 product owners in 5 locations.
- RQ: How often do you pair program?
- RQ: What is the test coverage on your code?

### Summary
Iterative shipments of working software increments, close customer collaboration.  Teams that adopted Agile reported many benefits.  Pair programming bridges knowledge gaps.  TDD results in more test automation at unit and system levels.  

### Conclusion
Agile is good.

# Automated Acceptance Testing Borge Haugset 2008

type:   **review and case study**
- how developers perceive impact of pair programming, test automation
- delivered feature scope, various teamwork aspects  
- 174 developers, 74 etams, 15 product owners in 5 locations.
- RQ: How often do you pair program?
- RQ: What is the test coverage on your code?
 
### Summary
Focuses on a case study of using automated acceptance testing in the industry and a literature review of AAT done in Agile settings.  A systematic literature review was undertaken utilizing key search phrases on indexing services, filtering these results further based on relevance of AAT in Agile, and synthesizing the remaining papers.  Main findings included good results from stating requirements in the form of acceptance tests, which also helped improve domain and system knowledge.  The case study further supported the literature review findings, where all 8 developers responded positively to the process and would continue to use AAT in new projects.  

### Strengths  
- Covers many aspects of AAT, especially the team communication aspects. 
- Cost/benefit analysis of writing and maintaining tests -- may not always be the best idea.  However, more frequent testing with automation can be a big bonus. 
- Explores some new topics, and doesn’t just focus on the positive effects of AAT.  

### Weaknesses
- The paper is a bit dense in that there are a lot of sections and topics.  The paper could be a bit more concise and have better organization of topics and findings.  
- Seems more focused on literature review than on adding new information through case study. 
- Selenium is mentioned a few times, but for most of the paper only Fit is discussed, even though they mention 2 projects on the case study, one using each.  Selenium is mentioned 15 times in the paper and half of those are in describing what it is and sources.  Fit is mentioned 77 times.   
- Seeing some actual Fit/Selenium test code would be nice -- how does AAT look when put into practice? 

### Conclusion
The paper is a bit vague. What is the scope of acceptance testing? How does it really differentiate itself?
Writing tests improved knowledge of system, but not the code.

# FitClipse: A Fit-Based Eclipse Plug-In Chengyao 2015

type:   **implementation of theory**

- Long period between creation of acceptance test and passing
- History relevant to the project is not generally tracked.
- Key difference:  TDD, unit tests are from developer's perspective, EATDD tests from business logic/customer perspective.
- Help developers better understand the requirements, ensure that the system meets those requirements, and to express development progress in a language that is understandable to customers. 

### Summary
A key issue in acceptance Executable Acceptance Test Driven Development is that there is often a long period of time between creating a test and making it pass.  FitClipse is an addition to Fit that keeps track of which tests have never passed, and which tests have passed before but have been broken by the latest code updates.  It also allows test history charts that can give a visual sense of project progress. 

### Strengths  
- Solves a key problem involved with acceptance testing. 
- Current tools are limited in supporting EATDD.
- Being able to view the passing and failing history of a certain test could help in tracking down a complex problem. 

# Weaknesses
- Self evaluation is admittedly weak.
- FitClipse is limited to an Eclipse plugin. 
- Could have discussed a bit more in detail related Eclipse plugins for Fit framework. 
- Their presmise is a bit flimsy - in TDD, you do not write all tests at once, rather you write a failing test and then the minimum amount of code to pass that test.  So for acceptance TDD, you would write a single acceptance test and work on that test until it passes -- why would this plugin then give extra knowledge, as every other acceptance test should be passing at all times except for the one currently being worked on? 


### Conclusion
The paper is a bit vague. What is the scope of acceptance testing? How does it really differentiate itself?
Writing tests improved knowledge of system, but not the code.

# Test-Driven Development of GUI Theodore 2011

type:   **system proposal**

### Summary
Test driven development of GUI elements is very difficult and generally involves complex test code or manual testing.  Writing failing tests can be challenging.  The authors propose an interface prototyping and usability evaluation system.  This was tested in a pilot study of 3 which found the idea useful and made GUI TDD easier, and suggested the need for a bigger, more comprehensive study.  

### Strengths  
- The test subjects had GUI development experience but no experience with UI prototyping, and little GUI test experience compared to development experience.  Since GUI testing is difficult, many opt not to do it and thus have little experience -- it seems this idea would target those developers more, so the lack of experience in the test subjects seems like a good idea. 
- Extensive detail of prototyping and pilot study procedures. 
- The idea seems to have merit, since every participant found it useful and would consider using it in their own development.  

### Weaknesses

- Pilot evaluation only included 3 developers, which is extremely small sample size. 
- The evaluation was short and the range is misleading - from A(1) to E(5), there are 3 positive responses and 2 negative responses.  This creates inherent bias in the responses.  Instead of very useful, somewhat useful, useful, not useful, the middle answer should be neutral, neither useful nor harmful.  
- Low time investment in pilot study and more complicated.
- While the 3 developers having little experience could be seen as a strength, it is also a weakness - the study would have been further strengthened by having an equal amount of experienced GUI testers to see reactions from both experienced and inexperienced developers.

# An Iterative Model for Agile Product Line Engineering Yaser 2008

type:   **theory/model proposal**

- Agile software dev (ASD) and software product line engineering (SPLE) 
- Integration of both is a challenge, but huge potential. 
- Model proposed, bottom-up application-driven with automated tests
- Acceptance tests as the cornerstone.

### Summary
Key difference is Agile is central to the model rather than supporting.  Product line built iteratively from bottom-up so the platform evolves.  


### Conclusion
Iterative, acceptance test driven model for agile product line engineering.  Initial stages of research.  Unanswered question: is TDD the most effective agile method in achieving SPLE goals? Overall, long paper but leaves many unfinished and unanswered questions.

# Information Visualization for Agile Software Julia 2014

### Summary
Effective communication is important for Agile teams, and complex information about software artifacts is best transmitted using visual media.  The paper examines several of the common information visualization techniques used in Agile to better understand their effectiveness, difficulties, and to raise awareness of these techniques by conducting an extensive literature review.  

### Strengths  
- Their methodology returned over 50 papers which they claim have relevance to the topic, which seems like a robust source of data. 
- In lieu of 3 strengths, I expanded greatly upon the weaknesses of the paper, as I struggled to find good strengths.  One might say the large number of cited papers, but are they effective citations or fluff?

### Weaknesses
- Too much of the paper seems like fluff.  I did not like the paper overall.  I felt like it could be cut in half easily, but also lacks important details.  The organization is rather poor - the citations are not very effective, and feel more like they are trying to claim legitimacy by large number of cited papers.  The goal of a paper like this is to synthesize other research, yet the information is all over the paper.  From their abstract: “...it is not clear what is the most effective technique…”  and “Our findings show that visualization techniques help Agile teams increase knowledge sharing and raise awareness”.  After reading the paper, I am still unable to answer what the most effective technique is.  Table II is a good start, but it needs to be improved on - for an example, the Design category, with purpose to understand overall system.  They cite 68 papers, how many of these 68 conclude IV techniques improve design? How did the listed papers conclude? all the papers in the chart concluded these techniques were helpful? There were no downsides? 
- Lack of metrics supporting their conclusion (i.e, 80% of papers reviewed concluded xxxx was helpful, etc.) and these should be visualized and highlighted. This paper is about transmitting information visually, and does a very poor job of that - the images are not very informative. 
- Whiteboards are barely mentioned in the paper, only one sentence.  This seems to be one of the most common/biggest means of communicating information visually with team members.  
- The effectiveness/difficulties of many methods were not examined - simply described. 
- Lack of effective visual tools.

#  A Case Study on the Impact of Scrum on Overtime and Customer Satisfaction Chris 2005


### Summary
A long-term industrial study evaluated employee overtime after adding Scrum processes to existing workflow.  Results showed increased customer satisfaction and reduced overtime, supporting the hypothesis.  

### Strengths  
- Detailed participant info for study reproduction.  
- Quotations supporting positions from customers and developers. 
- Statistics provided

### Weaknesses
- Threats to validity not discussed.  
- Time periods compared before/after Agile have differences beyond agile - different employees and work conditions. 
- Differing pressure to release products could affect overtime outcomes. 

### Conclusion
Study on Agile methods and their effectiveness.  Two-year-long study properly evaluates several factors and concludes Scrum increased customer satisfaction and reduced overtime.  Not controlled for conflicting factors.  Strong support using quotes from customers and developers.

#  Usability Evaluation Practices within Agile Development Tiago 2015

### Summary
An industrial case study on integrating UCD with Agile processes, focusing on a user-centered approach evaluating usability from the beginning, rather than at the end of the process. The paper focuses on the usability aspect of integration.  User testing was difficult to integrate with Agile’s fast iterations and often used internal employees instead of real users, if done at all.  The case study done corroborated literature review except for user testing. 

###Strengths
- Very detailed research procedure and companies involved.
- Multiple companies tested allow for comparison between them, and the companies were large. 
- Related work section establishes a strong background for the subject matter.
- Feedback from developers at company included in results. 

### Weaknesses
- Does not discuss threats to validity for implementing usability studies in other companies. 
- The results could be presented with better/more visuals. 
- Having another 2 companies using non-Agile process would allow greater comparison.

### Conclusion
User testing sessions are difficult to achieve, so measuring usability is tough. 

Usability study - important to distinguish usability vs UX. 
- Usability means easy to use -- can the user accomplish their goal? 

User experience
- Did the user have a good experience? 

UX starts by being **useful**, it meets the customer's needs.  The usability defines **ease of use**.  It should **look and feel** pleasing.  This contributes to the **overall experience**.

#  A Comparative Analysis of Traditional Software Engineering and Agile Software Development Ashley 2013

### Summary
What are the essential differences and incompatibilities? Variety of models, purpose, approach to modeling.  

We can merge ASD with TSE to form ASE.  

engineering versus development:
applying engineering principles, building/design, systematic, predict/plan/model.  

software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles to create software.

#  How Much Undocumented Knowledge is there in Agile Software Development? Shinobu 2017

### Summary
Untapped sources of documentation such as commits, issue tracking can provide valuable details.  In particular, each commit should be associated with an issue and can cause problems when it is not (no documentation)

#  User Experience Design and Agile Development Tiago 2012

### Summary
Existing research was synthesized into a framework for integrating UX and Agile.  Conducted a field study in a medium-sized company to combine theory and practice.  Knowledge gaps were identified and the framework was presented in detail.  

### Strengths
- A case study involving shadowing programmers and observing their daily happenings gives a good insight into the process and the implementation of theory. 
- Direct quotes were used from the participants to support their conclusions. 
- Well thought out framework.

### Weaknesses
- The idea of the study was sound, but this particular case study had some flaws - such as only shadowing the UX person. 
- A similar study in which the UX team is not working on multiple projects would be better. 
- Melding theory and practice often shows unexpected areas of lacking, which necessitates future study. 
- Perhaps too much information presented at once (very fragmented, could be more in depth and less in breadth)

#  Comparative Analysis of Job Satisfaction Grigori 2006

### Summary
Job dissatisfaction is a main driver of high turnover, which has a large economic impact on the company.  This paper examines the relationship between job satisfaction and development processes, concluding Agile practices lead to more satisfied developers in general.  Specifically, the amount of Agile experience was found to be highly correlated with job satisfaction. The major factors influencing job satisfaction involved having agency in decisions affecting them, working on interesting projects, and working with users/customers. 

### Strengths
- Clearly laid out research questions, null hypothesis, metrics, and statistical test used.  This gives a high level of confidence in the results. 
- Very detailed study allows for easy reproduction to verify conclusions.  
- Good background research on economic impact of turnover in development which motivates the study.
- Large (n>400) study.
- Broad categorization of job satisfaction.  
- Examination of job roles beyond developer.
- Acknowledged limitations of research and took steps to mitigate. 

### Weaknesses

- A large majority of respondents came from either North America or Europe.  Can we generalize the results to cultures/countries which are underrepresented or not represented at all?
- Specific research by design does not take into account external factors, left to future studies. 
- Lack of statistical knowledge may make the paper difficult to fully comprehend. 
- Some discussion about job satisfiers is warranted - why did they choose these 10 factors. 

### Conclusion
Agile developers are happier.  Who would have thought?
